      "Developed multiple interactive dashboards tailored for various user roles such as company admin, plant admin, transporter, and modules like asset management, user tracking, and visitor management. Each dashboard follows an on-demand data loading architecture â€” meaning only summary or essential data loads initially, and detailed or widget-specific data is fetched dynamically upon user interaction. Integrated real-time tracking and live data updates using WebSockets. The visualizations and analytics were built using Angular, Highcharts, and Chart.js, ensuring responsive and insightful user experiences.",
